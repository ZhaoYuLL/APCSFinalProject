# APCSFinalProject
Root Ninja
Group members: Brandon O'Connor, Zhao Yu lin

Our project will be a Processing game based off of the mobile sensation Fruit Ninja. However, to avoid copyright infringement, we will have the game centered around cutting root vegetables. In order to *beet* the game, the player will have to survive an onslaught of roots being tossed into the air, and the player must “cut” the roots with their mouse before it falls to the bottom of the screen, or else they will lose a life. But be careful, as you play, the number of roots thrown each second will increase, so only a true Root Ninja will be able to top the leaderboards. 

Compile/Run Instructions
Before playing, please add the Sound library provided by Processing. To do so, go to the Sketch tab in processing, then hover import library before clicking on "Add library." Search for "sound," then install the library created by The Processing Foundation.

Features:  
-Different game modes!  
-Unlockable skins when you get certain high scores!
